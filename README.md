MORSE CODE INVESTIGATION

"Morse code" is a method of encoding text characters using sequences of dots (`.`) and dashes (`–`) to represent each letter, numeral, or punctuation mark. It was developed in the 1830s and 1840s for use with early telecommunication systems, especially the telegraph.

Example

*Word: HELLO
*Morse: `.... . .-.. .-.. ---`

-The historical context for its creation includes:

1. Industrial Revolution:Brought rapid advancements in technology and the need for faster communication, especially for expanding commerce, railroads, and governance.


2. Limitations of existing communication: Before Morse code, long-distance messages were sent by mail or courier, which was slow and unreliable.


3. Development of the electric telegraph: Samuel Morse developed one of the first practical electric telegraphs. To make it useful, he needed a simple way to encode and transmit language over electrical signals.

-EXPLAINING HOW MORSE CODE WORKS:
Morse code works by "encoding letters, numbers, and punctuation into a series of short and long signals", which can be transmitted via sound, light, or electrical pulses.

-Core Principles of Morse Code:

1. Dots and Dashes:
*A dot (•) is a short signal.
*A dash (—) is a longer signal, typically three times the length of a dot.

2. Timing Rules:

   * Dot duration = basic unit of time.
   * Dash = 3 units.
   * Space between parts of the same letter = 1 unit.
   * Space between letters = 3 units.
   * Space between words = 7 units.

3. Example Encodings:

   * A = • —
   * B = — • • •
   * C = — • — •
   * SOS = • • • — — — • • • (used as a distress signal)

4. Transmission Methods:

   * Audible: Tones (like over radio)
   * Visual: Flashing lights or signal flags
   * Electrical: Telegraph lines transmitting current pulses

5. Why It Works So Well:

   * Morse code is **simple, low-tech, and resilient**—it works even under noisy or low-quality signal conditions.
   * It can be sent using any method that can distinguish between short and long signals, or on/off states.
