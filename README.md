MORSE CODE INVESTIGATION

"Morse code" is a method of encoding text characters using sequences of dots (`.`) and dashes (`‚Äì`) to represent each letter, numeral, or punctuation mark. It was developed in the 1830s and 1840s for use with early telecommunication systems, especially the telegraph.

-Usageüë§

* Originally used in telegraphy, later in radio communication.
* Widely used in military, aviation, and emergency signaling.
* The international distress signal SOS is encoded as `... --- ...`.

Example

*Word: HELLO
*Morse: `.... . .-.. .-.. ---`

-Modern Relevance

* Morse code is no longer widely used in commercial communication but is still learned by amateur radio operators.
* Some use it as a "backup communication tool", especially in emergencies or inaccessible environments.
Morse code was created in the early 19th century as a solution to a major communication problem: **how to transmit messages quickly over long distances**. Prior to this, communication relied on physical means‚Äîletters, messengers, or semaphore systems‚Äîwhich were slow and limited by geography and weather.

-Historical Context:

1. First Use and Spread:

   * The first successful long-distance telegraph message was sent by Morse in "1844" from Washington, D.C., to Baltimore: ‚ÄúWhat hath God wrought.‚Äù
   * The success of the telegraph system, powered by Morse code, led to its rapid adoption across the U.S. and eventually the world, transforming communication globally.

-EXPLAINING HOW MORSE CODE WORKS

* Morse code works by "encoding letters, numbers, and punctuation into a series of short and long signals", which can be transmitted via sound, light, or electrical pulses.

-Core Principles of Morse Code:

1. Dots and Dashes:

   * A dot (‚Ä¢) is a short signal.
   * A dash (‚Äî) is a longer signal, typically three times the length of a dot.

2. Timing Rules:

   * Dot duration = basic unit of time.
   * Dash = 3 units.
   * Space between parts of the same letter = 1 unit.
   * Space between letters = 3 units.
   * Space between words = 7 units.

3. Example Encodings:

   * A = ‚Ä¢ ‚Äî
   * B = ‚Äî ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢
   * C = ‚Äî ‚Ä¢ ‚Äî ‚Ä¢
   * SOS = ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ (used as a distress signal)

4. Transmission Methods:

   * Audible: Tones (like over radio)
   * Visual: Flashing lights or signal flags
   * Electrical: Telegraph lines transmitting current pulses

5. Why It Works So Well:

   * Morse code is **simple, low-tech, and resilient**‚Äîit works even under noisy or low-quality signal conditions.
   * It can be sent using any method that can distinguish between short and long signals, or on/off states.
